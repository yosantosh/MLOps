1 ----> Class and objects

2 ----> Functions vs method : Functions inside the class is called methods.

3 ----> Self : is a object that work as mediator to store attributes of class. 
        so when we creare object of the class then the magic method __init__ which 
        is a contstructor methd which get called automtically and thats how attributes 
        get initialized in self object.

        So if you want any method to call automatically then initialize calling inside __init__ like self.any_method()

        When we define any method then we pass self as parameter why?
        beacause thats how python connect methods with the class and main is
        while calling method for example like this Class.any_method()  then python automaticaclly 
        pass the self as Argument input. 


4 ----> we can create attributes outside the class as well.


5 ----> Encapsulation :
