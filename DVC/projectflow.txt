1 ----> create data_generator.py file to generate data and move inside the Data folder

2 ----> Initialize the DVC by using dvc init , install it using pip intall dvc

3 ----> Create S3 dir to feel AWS s3  

4 ----> Assign the folder(S3) to push Data versions into this
                            |
                            |---> URL for AWS S3 bucket instead of this folder name

5 ----> dvc remort add -d MyRemort S3      : MyRemort will be s3 server 


        remort : to add remort storage service
        -d     : to Choose this remort storage as default so in future dvc command it will choose it as default
        MyRemort: Any name of that Remort storage 
        S3      : Path of that remort storage



6 ---->   dvc add Data/         : To start tracking the Data folder for all Data sets


7 ----> git add Data.dvc     : to connect dvc with git , so that it will make md5 code for each changes in code , data will get change when code get changed.


8 ----> dvc commit and push,   dvc will gonna add data.csv in the S3 with dvc push command 


9 ----> Git add-commit-push so that it will save code and data version as same , like if we want to rollback to the same code and data.


10 ----> saved three versions of data

11 ----> Roll back from version 3 to 2: just copy git shaa id for the data version 2 commit, then rollback
        by   " git checkout shaa id"

12 ---->dvc pull : But there is the problem , when git will do rollback to 2nd version commit then md5 code will change in Data.dvc
        and dvc status will indicate that something get changed , 
        so we need ,  "dvc pull" to rollback the data too.

        : So basically we need to keep tracking Data.dvc file by git and then use "dvc pull" to pull data with md5 code written in Data.csv
